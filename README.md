# Cell Tower Location Optimization

This repository includes all the files required for optimizing the cell tower placement.  Specifically, the cost of infrastructure is minimized with the constraint that all calls must be covered.

The component files of this solution are:
- A Python (2.7) program, which interacts with a MySQL database and the Gurobi optimization software package
- A .sql dump file to construct the MySQL database

The user must install Gurobi in order to execute this solution.
